## ‚ú® Features

- **Upload Shapefiles**: Easily upload your own zipped shapefiles.
- **Interactive Map**: View your polygons on an interactive Leaflet map.
- **Download Table**: Download the polygon data in tabular
  representation for further processing.
- **Select Polygons**:
  - Click directly on the map to select individual polygons.
  - Upload a `.csv` file containing a list of polygon IDs to select them
    in bulk.
- **Generate Survey Solutions Files**:
  - Create the boundary file in *ESRI shape file format* required for
    geography questions.
  - Generate `.tpk` or `.tif` base maps for offline use in the Survey
    Solutions Interviewer App.
- **Download Outputs**: Download the generated files directly from the
  application.
- **Survey Solutions API Interface**: Send and assign spatial resources
  directly to the Survey Solutions server through the API interface.

## Important Note

The tool leverages external base map tile providers. Please be aware
that these services have their own Terms of Use. Some may require an API
key and/or may be subject to usage limits.

For the production of [Open Street
Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/38.00/-95.84), [ESRI world
imagery](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=10df2279f9684e4a9f6a7f08febac2a9),
and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) Maps, the tool uses the [R
basemaps package](https://github.com/16EAGLE/basemaps). Additionally
Mapbox maps also require a valid license key.

For the production of [ESRI .tpk
files](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/user-types/explore/creator),
you require a valid license key. The module uses its own API calls, and
credentials must be provided through the app.

## Installation

- Install R: <https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html> (version 4.1.1 or
  greater)

- Install R Studio: <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>
  (version 1.2.5001-3 or newer)

- Make sure the *devtools* package is installed, if not install it with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

- After that install the actual package:

``` r
devtools::install_github("michael-cw/susobasemap")
```

## üöÄ Start the application

### From RStudio

``` r
library(susobasemap)
susobasemap::runBaseMapApp()
```

### On a Shiny Server

In case you are considering to run the application on a shiny server,
you just need to create the following app.R script in your shiny server
app directory:

``` r
library(susobasemap)
susobasemap::runBaseMapAppServer()
```

## How it works

Follow these steps to generate your Survey Solutions files:

1.  **Upload Shapefile**:

- In the ‚ÄúUpload shapefile‚Äù section, click ‚ÄúBrowse‚Ä¶‚Äù and select a `.zip`
  file containing your shapefile (`.shp`, `.shx`, `.dbf`, etc.).
- The application will automatically unzip and load the shapefile.

2.  **Select a Unique ID**:

- Once the shapefile is loaded, you will be prompted to select the
  column from your shapefile‚Äôs attribute table that contains a unique
  identifier for each polygon. This is crucial for linking selections to
  the correct polygons.

3.  **Select Polygons**:
    - You have two options for selecting the polygons you want to
      include in your boundary file and base map:
      - **Option A: Select on Map**: Click on individual polygons on the
        interactive map. Selected polygons will be highlighted, and
        their IDs will appear in a table. You can deselect a polygon by
        clicking it again.
      - **Option B: Upload a List of IDs**: Upload a single-column
        `.csv` file containing the unique IDs of the polygons you wish
        to select. The application will match these IDs with the unique
        ID column you selected earlier.
4.  **Generate and Download Files**:
    - You will see a summary of your selected polygons in the ‚ÄúSelection
      Summary‚Äù section.
    - Move on to the ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù section
      - Click **‚ÄúGenerate Boundary File‚Äù** to create the `.geojson` file
        for your Survey Solutions geography question.
      - Click **‚ÄúGenerate Base Map‚Äù** to create the offline map package
        (`.tpk` or `.mbtiles`).
      - Once generated, click the corresponding **‚ÄúDownload‚Äù** button to
        save the files to your computer.
      - The download button ‚ÄúTable‚Äù allows you to download the shape
        file data immediately after upload in tabular form, i.e.¬†for
        sampling or other frame specfic activities.
