## âœ¨ Features

- **Upload Shapefiles**: Easily upload your own zipped shapefiles.
- **Interactive Map**: View your polygons on an interactive Leaflet map.
- **Download Table**: Download the polygon data in tabular
  representation for further processing.
- **Select Polygons**:
  - Click directly on the map to select individual polygons.
  - Upload a `.csv` or `.txt` file containing a list of polygon IDs to
    select them in bulk.
- **Generate Survey Solutions Files**:
  - Create the boundary file in *ESRI shape file format* required for
    geography questions.
  - Generate `.tpk` or `.tif` base maps for offline use in the Survey
    Solutions Interviewer App.
- **Download Outputs**: Download the generated files directly from the
  application.
- **UPCOMING**: Send spatial resources directly to the Survey Solutions
  server through the API interface.

## Important Note

The tool leverages external base map tile providers. Please be aware
that these services have their own Terms of Use. Some may require a free
API key or have usage limits.

For the production of [Open Street
Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/38.00/-95.84), [ESRI world
imagery](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=10df2279f9684e4a9f6a7f08febac2a9),
and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) Maps, the tool uses the [R
basemaps package](https://github.com/16EAGLE/basemaps). Additionally
Mapbox maps also require a valid license key.

For the production of [ESRI .tpk
files](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/user-types/explore/creator),
you require a valid license key. The module uses its own API calls, and
credentials must be provided through the app.
